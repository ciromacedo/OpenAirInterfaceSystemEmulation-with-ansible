# oaisim-with-ansible
This project aims to build a playbook for implementing the elements that make up the [OpenAirInterface System Emulation](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/wikis/OpenAirLTEEmulation). To use the playbook you need the following elements:

1. A machine called 'operator's machine', running Linux and with a properly installed version of [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/). The next sections will present the steps for installing Ansible.
2. A machine for installing the eNB (and if applicable, to simulate the UE's).
3. One machine for installing the EPC core.
