# oaisim-with-ansible
This project aims to build a playbook for implementing the elements that make up the [OpenAirInterface System Emulation](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/wikis/OpenAirLTEEmulation). To use the playbook you need the following elements:

1. A machine called 'operator's machine', running Linux and with a properly installed version of [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/). The next sections will present the steps for installing Ansible.
2. A machine for installing the eNB (and if applicable, to simulate the UE's).
3. One machine for installing the EPC core.

We assume that the <b>all machines are connected to the internet</b> and <i>see each other</i>.
## Installation Guide
The first thing to do, is configure the <i>operator machine</i>.

### Ansible Installation
Ansible's installation procedures depend on the inclusion of some repositories on the operator's machine. Depending on the distribution uses the commands for the inclusion of these repositories they can change, for more information see [this page](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-the-control-node) . The next steps works to <b>linux Ubuntu 18.04+ LTS</b>
